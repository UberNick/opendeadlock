## Building and running

### Environment Setup

#### Git

Git is used for source control, and can be downloaded here:

* https://git-scm.com/downloads

#### Flutter

The Flutter framework and its dependencies are required to compile this project.

* https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

The easiest way to do this is to clone the project then run flutter doctor

Note that Flutter has additional dependencies based on the system being used and type of output being used. Flutter doctor should take care of most dependencies and warn about anything that's missing.
